  <div id='MainText' class='maintext'>Children are sitting in a circle, and a teacher walks around the circle, dealing
    cards. The teacher gives a Jack to every second child, and a Queen to every third child.

    After going around four times, the sixth child in the circle from where the teacher started has two Jacks and two
    Queens.

    What is the smallest possible number of children in the circle?</div>

      <h3>Correct Answer: 7</h3>
      <div>The teacher goes round the circle four times. If there was an even number of children, the sixth child would
        always receive a Jack each time and would have four Jacks by the end. Since they only have two Jacks, there must
        be an odd number of children in the circle.

        The sixth child receives a Queen in the first round because 6 is a multiple of 3. She only receives one more
        Queen so the answer can't be a multiple of 3.

        The options are 7, 11, 13, 17, 19 â€¦ and so 7 is the fewest number of children. </div>
